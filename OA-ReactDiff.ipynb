It transforms noisy data into clean data samples by modeling a diffusion process.\n","\n","These models focus on modeling the distribution of the data and simulate a gradual evolution from a simple distribution to a more complex distribution. The basic concept of a diffusion model is to transform a simple and easily sampled distribution, usually a normal distribution, into a more complex data distribution. This transformation is achieved through a series of reversible operations. Once the model has learned the transformation process, it can generate new samples by starting from a point in the simple distribution and gradually \"denoising\" to the desired complex data distribution.\n","\n","The training of the DDPM model requires knowledge of the parameters of the diffusion process to effectively capture the relationship between clean and noisy data at each transformation step.
